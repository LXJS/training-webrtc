"Imagine a world where your phone, TV and computer could all communicate on a common platform. Imagine it was easy to add video chat and peer-to-peer data sharing to your web application. That's the vision of WebRTC." â€” Sam Dutton

**WebRTC** (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API drafted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that supports **browser-to-browser applications for voice calling, video chat, and P2P file sharing without plugins.**

## Overview

### Topics

In this workshop at LXJS 2014, we will cover:

- What is WebRTC?
- What types of apps and features does WebRTC enable you to build?
- How to create WebRTC video/voice chat apps
  - How to create peer-to-peer connections in the browser
  - How to use `getUserMedia` to capture the user's webcam and microphone
  - How the "signaling process" allows us to connect two peers, and why it's necessary
  - How to write server-side (node.js) code to facilitate the signaling process
- How to create WebRTC data channel apps
  - How to send binary and text data
  - How to create reliable (tcp-like) and unreliable (udp-like) data channels
- How to handle browser differences

### Products using WebRTC

Check out some of the real-world products that make use of WebRTC:

- [Talky](http://talky.io/) - Simple video chat
- [ShareFest](http://sharefest.me) - Simple file sharing
- [PeerCDN](http://peercdn.com) (the original) / [Peer5](http://peer5.com) / SwarmCDN / StreamRoot - P2P CDNs
- Chromecast
- Amazon Kindle thing
- Snapchat (WebRTC acquisition)
- Mozilla browse together thing - togetherJS?

### Experimental WebRTC Projects

Mad scientists are pushing WebRTC to its limits. Check out some crazy projects:

- [Peer-Server](http://peer-server.com) - server backend in the browser
- [WebTorrent](http://webtorrent.io) - streaming bittorrent client in the browser

### WebRTC Vendors

- GoInstant

## Sound interesting?

Great! Here's how to get ready.

### Pre-Workshop Preparation

In order to prepare for this workshop, should read the following articles before arriving at LXJS! If you have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LXJS/training-webrtc/issues) and we will be glad to answer. You might be helping other participants!

### Todo List

- [ ] Read [Getting Started with WebRTC](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/basics/)
- [ ] Watch Google I/O WebRTC 2013 presentation
- [ ] Check out talky.io and sharefest.me

### Additional Resources

These are not required, but if you want to hack on WebRTC code before you get to LXJS, you should check out the following links (with sample code!)
